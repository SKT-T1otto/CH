# Cross-repository environment contract diff

These values are frozen from the same CPU smoke protocol (seed 1729, reset once, then three zero-action steps). The hashes cover the live state fields listed in each JSON contract.

| Contract item | CH3 | CH4 | CH5 |

| Observation contract | `28-D local block` | `28-D local + 3×37-D neighbor blocks` | `28-D local + 3×37-D acoustic/semantic neighbor blocks` |
| Action dims | `[3, 3, 3, 3]` | `[3, 3, 3, 3]` | `[3, 3, 3, 3]` |
| Reward vector shape | `[4]` | `[4]` | `[4]` |
| Target motion default | `static` | `static` | `static` |
| Obstacle default | `False` | `False` | `False` |
| Disturbance default | `nominal/no CH4 protocol` | `False` | `False` |

## Shared mission semantics

All repositories preserve four ordered roles, a three-dimensional residual-acceleration action, per-agent rewards, searcher detection (`task_found`), executor knowledge handoff, and executor capture/hold completion. Exact definitions are recorded in the JSON contracts.

## Material differences

CH3 observes only the 28-D local mission block and uses fixed reliable one-step handoff. CH4/CH5 append three 37-D neighbor communication blocks. CH4 retains plant-disturbance machinery but rejects removed Chapter-5 semantic/robust switches; CH5 contains the acoustic loss/delay/bandwidth/TTL queues and semantic communication state. Default construction is nominal; formal experiment configuration remains separately locked by its retained protocol/evidence.

A hash difference across repositories is expected because the state schemas and communication state differ. A future change within the same repository is a contract-review trigger, not an automatic approval to update the fixture.
